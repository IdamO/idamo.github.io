    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Inspired by fitness tracking apps, <a href="https://github.com/IdamO/Alang" target="_blank">Alang</a> helps keep track of and improve grammar by providing corrective feedback to users whenever 
          it encounters a grammatical error in speech. It also tracks data over extended periods of time in order to give the user an idea of progress and/or regress made over said periods.</p>
    
    <p>Alang was developed by me and two other people I had just met at the education hackathon in San Francisco. The main goal we had in mind for the app was to break down communication barriers which exist in the diverse world of tech, as well as other industries and social environments.</p>
    <p><b>Languages</b>: C & JavaScript.</p>
    
    <h2>Development Process</h2>
    
    <p>Like most projects, this app was divided into 3 main sections: Front end, Back end, and UI/UX (User Interface/User Experience). While we all eventually got to dabble with each of these sections, we all had our own areas of focus. For this project, I worked on the <b>Back end</b> side of things. More specifically, I worked on: communication with the watch OS, speech-to-text translation, algorithms & data structures, and sending information for display on multiple platforms.</p>
    
    <h3>Watch OS (App-to-Mic) Communication</h3>
    <p>How does the app know when it is listening to input?  </p>
    
    <p>In addition to working with client teams, I also spent significant time working on a few long-term projects.  The major one I was a part of was EY's College MAP program</a>.  It's a company-sponsored program that provides low-income students with the mentoring and assistance they need to achieve their academic goals.  The program is aimed at high school students in the bay area, and has made a lasting impact on the local communities.</p>

    <p>I've been a volunteer tutor for over 6 years, so it's great that I can use my passion for helping students as part of my internship experience.  Ultimately, I've found that EY is eager to utilize their employee's backgrounds to better serve their clients.</p>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>Going into the internship, I wasn't too sure if it would be a good fit.  My background was in computer science, <i>not</i> business, so there was always some uncertainty in my mind about whether I'd like it or not.</p>

    <p>I'm glad that I took the chance, because it's been a really really great experience.  Everybody (partners, managers, executive directors, ...) is more that happy to answer questions and share their experiences.  There were plenty of times when I was working with a client team and had no idea what I was doing, but I always had the resources to learn and grow.</p>

    <p>Another thing that really stuck with me was the focus on people.  EY is a massive, $30billion/year company, but I always felt like a valued part of the team.  EY's internal slogan seems to be "it's all about the people", and it certainly shows.</p>

    <p>Each and every day, I was given the opportunity to learn, grow, and connect with people.  Working with EY's diverse teams helped me sharpen my communication skills and better empathize with those around me.</p>

    <p>All in all, this internship has easily been one of the best summers I've ever had.  I've learned so much about business, teamwork, and effective communication.  The people I've met and the connections I've forged will stay with me even after I return to school.</p>
